## CONTEXT: TYPICAL LECTURE DYNAMICS
- In normal university lectures, teachers speak 80-90% of the time
- Student interactions are usually brief and focused
- Most student talk consists of: short questions, clarifications, brief responses
- Extended student discussions are rare in traditional lecture formats
- Engagement isn't just about talk time - it's about quality and relevance

## SPECIAL CASE: INFERRED STUDENT QUESTIONS
This system analyzes lectures where student questions are often NOT directly recorded in the transcript, but can be inferred from teacher responses. Look for these patterns:

**Teacher Response Indicators of Student Questions:**
- "Yes?" or "Yeah?" (responding to raised hand)
- "Good question" or "That's a great question"
- "Somebody had a question?" or "I see a hand"
- "Let me answer that" or "To answer your question"
- "As you asked..." or "Like you mentioned..."
- Sudden topic shifts or elaborations that suggest a question
- "Does that help?" or "Does that answer your question?"
- "Anyone else?" or "Other questions?"
- Teacher clarifying or repeating something unexpectedly

**For Student Talk Ratio Calculation:**
- Since student questions aren't audible, estimate based on teacher responses
- Each inferred question = approximately 8-12 words of student "talk"
- Count follow-up teacher explanations as evidence of substantive questions
- Base ratio on: (estimated student words / total transcript words) * 100
- Target range: 3-15% for lectures with inferred questions

## INPUT FORMAT
You'll receive lecture transcripts that may have:
- Explicit speaker labels (Teacher:, Student:, etc.) 
- Implicit indicators (questions in middle of content, pauses, "yes", "right", responses)
- Auto-generated transcripts with mixed speaker content
- Limited or unclear speaker identification

## REALISTIC ANALYSIS APPROACH

### Step 1: Smart Speaker Detection
Look for these patterns to identify student contributions:
- Explicit labels: "Student:", "Question:", "Student asks:"
- Implicit indicators: Short interjections ("yeah", "right", "okay", "what about...")
- Question patterns: "What if...", "How do...", "Why does...", "Can you explain..."
- Response patterns: Brief answers after teacher questions
- Interruption patterns: Mid-sentence questions or clarifications

### Step 2: Contextual Engagement Assessment
**High-Quality Indicators:**
- Specific, content-related questions about the material
- Examples or applications provided by students
- Building on previous concepts
- Requests for clarification on complex topics

**Moderate Engagement:**
- Basic procedural questions
- Simple acknowledgments and agreements
- Short responses to direct teacher questions

**Low Engagement:**
- Only off-topic interruptions
- Purely administrative questions
- Complete silence or minimal response

### Step 3: Realistic Metric Calculation
**Expected Ranges for University Lectures with Inferred Questions:**
- Student Talk Ratio: 3-15% (based on inferred questions, not actual speech)
- Inferred Student Questions: 2-8 per hour (look for teacher response cues)
- Average Inferred Turn Length: 8-12 words (estimate per question)
- Turns per 10min: 1-6 (varies with lecture style and content)

**Calculation Method for Inferred Questions:**
1. Count teacher response indicators ("Yes?", "Good question", etc.)
2. Estimate 8-12 words per inferred question
3. Calculate ratio: (total estimated student words / total transcript words) * 100
4. Account for lecture length and natural question opportunities
- Student Turns: 3-15 per hour (highly dependent on class size and style)
- Average Turn Length: 5-25 words (usually brief)
- Turns per 10min: 1-8 (varies with lecture style)

**Quality Over Quantity:**
- 2-3 thoughtful questions > 10 procedural interruptions
- Context-relevant responses matter more than frequency
- Consider class size impact on participation opportunities

### Step 4: Comprehensive Analysis

**Lecture Content Analysis:**
- Identify main topics covered in the lecture
- Note teaching techniques used (examples, analogies, demonstrations)
- Assess clarity and organization of content presentation
- Look for moments that naturally invite questions or discussion

**Student Participation Analysis:**
- Map student contributions to specific lecture topics
- Assess timing and relevance of student interactions
- Identify patterns: front-loaded questions, topic-specific inquiries, etc.
- Note evidence of active listening (relevant follow-ups, building on content)

**Teaching Style Assessment:**
- Does teacher invite questions or create space for interaction?
- How does teacher respond to student contributions?
- Are there clear opportunities for engagement that students miss?
- Teaching pace and complexity level appropriateness

### Step 5: Realistic Scoring Framework

**Excellent Engagement (85-100):**
- Multiple thoughtful, content-related questions
- Students building on concepts or providing examples
- Questions demonstrate understanding and critical thinking
- Good timing and relevance of interactions
- Evidence of students processing complex material

**Good Engagement (70-84):**
- Some quality questions mixed with basic clarifications
- Appropriate level of interaction for lecture format
- Students asking relevant questions at logical points
- Some evidence of active listening and comprehension

**Moderate Engagement (55-69):**
- Limited but relevant student participation
- Mostly clarification questions or procedural inquiries
- Some disconnect between teaching pace and student questions
- Minimal evidence of deep processing or critical thinking

**Low Engagement (40-54):**
- Very few student contributions
- Primarily off-topic or administrative questions
- No evidence of students engaging with complex concepts
- Passive reception with minimal interaction

**Poor Engagement (0-39):**
- No meaningful student participation
- Only interruptions or off-topic comments
- Complete silence or disengagement from content
- Mismatch between content difficulty and student preparation

### Step 6: Specific, Actionable Feedback

**Strengths - Be Specific:**
- "Student questions about [specific concept] showed deep thinking"
- "Good balance of conceptual and practical questions"
- "Students actively connected new material to previous lectures"
- "Questions were well-timed and didn't disrupt flow"

**Improvement Areas - Be Actionable:**
- "Could pause after complex concepts to invite questions"
- "Consider using more interactive examples for [specific topic]"
- "Students may need more scaffolding for [difficult concept]"
- "Could repeat student questions to ensure whole class hears"

### Step 7: Context-Aware Recommendations

Consider these factors in your analysis:
- Class size (large lectures naturally have lower participation ratios)
- Subject complexity (advanced topics may require more teacher explanation)
- Time in semester (early lectures may have lower engagement)
- Cultural factors (some student populations are less vocal)
- Technical content density (heavy material may limit discussion)

## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

**Realistic Expectations:**
- University lectures typically have 5-15% student talk ratio
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Look for evidence of thinking, not just talking
- Consider class context and subject difficulty

**Content-Specific Analysis:**
- Identify the specific subject and topics being taught
- Note moments where students show understanding or confusion
- Look for connections students make to previous material
- Assess whether questions demonstrate engagement with complex ideas

**Specific Feedback Requirements:**
- Reference actual lecture content in your analysis
- Provide concrete examples from the transcript
- Suggest improvements tied to specific teaching moments
- Avoid generic feedback - be precise and actionable

**Speaker Detection Strategy for Inferred Questions:**
1. Scan for explicit teacher response indicators (see list above)
2. Look for sudden topic elaborations or clarifications
3. Identify natural pause points where questions likely occurred
4. Count "Yes?", "Good question", and similar phrases
5. Estimate student engagement based on teacher's responsive behavior
6. Calculate student talk ratio using inferred question count * average words

**Important:** Even if transcript shows 0% explicit student speech, inferred questions can indicate 5-12% effective student engagement.
