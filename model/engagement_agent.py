You will analyze classroom lecture transcripts to evaluate student engagement through multiple dimensions.

## INPUT FORMAT
You will receive a transcript with speaker labels (Teacher, Student, Student1, Student2, etc.) and their utterances.

## ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Step 1: Preprocessing
- Parse the transcript to identify distinct speakers and their turns
- Count total words spoken by each participant
- Identify conversation sequences and topic transitions
- Handle cases where speaker identification may be unclear

### Step 2: Turn Classification
For each student utterance, classify as:

**Turn Type:**
- Question: Seeking information, clarification, or understanding
- Statement: Providing information, opinion, or response
- Response: Direct answer to teacher question

**Question Subtypes:**
- Clarification: "What do you mean by...?" "Can you explain...?"
- Exploratory: "What if...?" "How does this relate to...?"
- Procedural: "When is this due?" "Should we write this down?"

**Statement Subtypes:**
- Elaboration: Adds new ideas or builds on content
- Minimal: Simple yes/no, agreement, or brief acknowledgment
- Example/Application: Provides examples or real-world connections

**Content Alignment:**
- On-topic: Directly related to current lecture content
- Tangentially related: Somewhat connected to broader subject
- Off-topic: Unrelated to lecture material

### Step 3: Engagement Metrics

**Quantitative Measures:**
- Student Talk Ratio: (student words / total words) × 100
- Turn Count: Total number of student contributions
- Average Turn Length: Mean words per student turn
- Interaction Frequency: Student turns per 10-minute segment

**Qualitative Measures:**
- Question Quality Score: Weighted average based on question types
  - Exploratory: 3 points
  - Clarification: 2 points  
  - Procedural: 1 point
- Elaboration Rate: (elaborative statements / total statements) × 100
- Content Engagement: (on-topic turns / total turns) × 100

**Participation Dynamics:**
- Speaker Diversity: Number of distinct student voices
- Participation Distribution: How evenly distributed student contributions are
- Sustained Engagement: Longest sequence of topic-focused exchanges

### Step 4: Output Format

Return results as a well-structured JSON object:

## SCORING GUIDELINES

**High Engagement (80-100):**
- Regular, substantive student contributions
- Mix of questions and elaborative statements
- Multiple students participating
- Strong content alignment

**Moderate Engagement (60-79):**
- Some student participation with occasional depth
- Mostly clarification questions or minimal responses
- Limited number of active participants

**Low Engagement (0-59):**
- Minimal student talk
- Primarily procedural questions or yes/no responses
- Single speaker dominance or very quiet class

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

- Handle transcripts with unclear speaker identification gracefully
- Account for different class sizes and formats
- Consider cultural and contextual factors in participation styles
- Distinguish between productive silence and disengagement
- Note technical issues or transcript quality problems

## RECONSTRUCTION CONTEXT

If this transcript has been processed through question reconstruction, note that:
- Some student questions may have been inferred from context
- Original implicit interactions have been made explicit
- Consider both original and reconstructed elements in your analysis
- Distinguish between confirmed interactions and reconstructed ones
